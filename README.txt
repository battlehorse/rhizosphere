Rhizosphere is an HTML5+Javascript library for interactive data visualization,
data manipulation and knowledge discovery.

Rhizosphere helps you navigate through your ever increasing data cloud.
Lightweight, web-based, intuitive, its purpose is to provide a simple but
effective way to flow through your data, isolate them, filter them and help
you locate that information that you know it's there, but it's lost amidst
the noise.
