  This file defines the default Rhizosphere theme, in the form of a CSS
  file that fully describe the visualization UI and styles.

  It also illustrates how themes are assembled and how a custom one can be
  defined. To define a new theme, create a new LESS file using alternative
  combinations of color schemes and/or skinning rules.

/*
  The first element that all themes require is the definition of the
  fundament elements of the visualization. These are defined in
  rhizo.chrome.less and all themes should import it without changing.

/*
  The second element to define is the color scheme the theme will use.
*/
@import "rhizo.colors.default.less";

/*
  The third element to define is the actual set of skinning rules (borders,
  spacings, corners, shadows, sizes), which also adopts the color scheme defined
  above.
