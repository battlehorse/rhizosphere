/*
  This file defines the default (blue) color scheme for a Rhizosphere
  visualization. It can be swapped with other color schemes when skinning
  a visualization.
*/

/******************
  Main palette
 *****************/

/*
  The Rhizosphere color palette is divided into primary (used for the main
  UI skinning) and alternate (for UI elements that are contraposed to primary
  ones, such as section headers vs section contents). Within each group, colors
  are defined for fonts, backgrounds, controls (such as buttons and icons) and
  generic interface elements (such as borders and separators).

  In addition to the main palette, a few specific components, such as the
  visualization viewport, have specific named colors assigned to them.

  All the colors for specific interface elements are computed from the given
  palette in rhizo.colors.derived.less. For basic color theming it should be
  enough to alter the palette colors defined here. For more advanced theming,
  each single interface element color can be overriden by altering its assigned
  color after the 'derived' file has been imported.
