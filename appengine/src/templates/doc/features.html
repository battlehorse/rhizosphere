<h1>Features</h1>
<p>
  Rhizosphere project focuses both on traditional and innovative ways to browse
  through data. Here follows a selection of library features.
</p>
<p>
  Rhizosphere launches and iterates often. Keep an eye at the
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/rhizosphereui/Home/announcements">
    Announcements
  </a> section of the project site, or follow
  <a href="http://twitter.com/rhizosphere">Rhizosphere on Twitter</a> for the
  latest news and releases.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Pure Javascript and HTML5
  </dt>
  <dd>
    No Flash. No Silverlight. No plugins needed. Your browser alone is just
    fine. We leverage HTML5 features to provide a better user experience (see
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/rhizosphereui/Home/announcements/statefulvisualizationswithhtml5history">
      this example
    </a>, about history and state management).
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Small footprint
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Rhizosphere library is only 26Kb once minified and gzipped. Once you
    include the dependent libraries (jQuery, jQuery UI) it fits within 60-70Kb.
    Client side caching means the user pays the load cost only the first time
    it uses the library.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Speed
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Sub-second response times for most operations, even on big datasets with
    thousands of datapoints. See latest
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/rhizosphereui/Home/announcements/fastdommanipulation">benchmarks</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    From high end PCs to Portable devices
  </dt>
  <dd>
    From high-power desktop PCs all the way down to tablets and smartphones.
    You can run Rhizosphere visualizations on all of them.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Embeddable
  </dt>
  <dd>
    You can use Rhizosphere to create a stand-alone full-page visualization, or
    you can embed it anywhere you want: in your webpages, as a Google
    Spreadsheet or iGoogle gadget. You can have multiple visualizations per
    page.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Google Web Toolkit integration
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rhizosphere fully integrates with <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">
    Google Web Toolkit</a>. If you develop applications with GWT, you can use
    Rhizosphere inside your apps without having to write a single line of
    Javascript, and taking advantage of GWT features you are used to, like
    UiBinder templates and the widget framework.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Spatial navigation
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rhizosphere behaves like a physical desktop with support for drag'n'drop,
    groups selections, zooming, endless panning (aka Google Maps-like scrolling)
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Multiple layout algorithms
  </dt>
  <dd>
    To help you organize your data: plain, clusters, trees, treemaps and more.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Dynamic filters
  </dt>
  <dd>
    To let you isolate, slice, partition your datasets and focus only on the
    subset of data you care about.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    UI Customization
  </dt>
  <dd>
    You can tweak any aspect of the visualization, from the color scheme to use
    to the UI layout, up to the rendering algorithm of each data point you
    visualize.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Integration with multiple data sources
  </dt>
  <dd>
    You can feed Rhizosphere data via
    <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/interactive_charts.html">
      Google Visualization API
    </a> datasources, Google Spreadsheets or using its custom input format.
    Custom data sources can be added easily.
