<h1>Use with iGoogle</h1>
<p>This page describes how you can use Rhizosphere gadgets inside your
  <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle homepage</a>.
</p>

<p>
  To use Rhizosphere in your iGoogle page, first you identify a Google
  Spreadsheet that contains the data you want to display. Once you have it,
  follow <a href="/doc/users_spreadsheets.html">these instructions</a> to setup the
  gadget inside the spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>
  From within the spreadsheet, open the gadget menu from the top-right corner
  of the Rhizosphere Gadget, and choose the <b>Add Gadget to iGoogle</b>
  option. That's it. Really easy (thanks Google)!

  <strong>Tip</strong>. By clicking the maximize icon in the top-right corner
  of the Rhizosphere gadget, you can switch to fullscreen mode, exactly in the
  same way as described for the
  <a href="/doc/users_spreadsheets.html">spreadsheet case</a>.
