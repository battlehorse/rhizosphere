<h1>Getting Started with Rhizosphere</h1>
<p>This page explains the basic Rhizosphere concepts and you can use it
to visualize your own data.</p>
<p>
  The basic concept behind Rhizosphere is to let you load datasets of your
  choice and let you manipulate their contents like you would do if they
  were physical items.
</p>
<p>
  No matter whether you are using Rhizosphere to visualize the contents of your
  Picasa photo albums, Google Books search results to find something to buy or
  anything else you care about, Rhizosphere will display all such items for you
  and let you freely re-arrange them by sorting, grouping and filtering them
  according to the specific characteristics of your data.
</p>

<h3>Try out the demos</h3>
<p>
  The easiest way to experience Rhizosphere is to try it out with some of the
  demos. You can find
  <a href="http://www.rhizospherejs.com">all the demos here</a>.
</p>

<h2>The Rhizosphere user interface</h2>
<p>This screenshot shows you the Rhizosphere user interface. It is divided into
  2 main areas: a viewport area on the right, where the items loaded from your
  data source are visualized, and a control panel on the left that you can use
  to customize the visualization.</p>
<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>. The screenshot shows how Rhizosphere looks when
  rendered as a standalone full-page visualization on a desktop PC. Other
  scenarios, such as embedded use or use with a mobile device, have
  different rendering, but the interaction patterns described here still
  apply. See the screenshot linked to
  <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/rhizosphereui/Home/announcements/aloadoftouch-relatedenhancements">
    blog post</a> to get an idea of different UIs.

<p>
  Four main controls form the Rhizosphere interface:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The viewport area that displays items loaded from your datasource.</li>
  <li>The layout picker.</li>
  <li>The selection manager.</li>
  <li>The filters section.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The viewport</h3>
<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>. Click on any image for an enlarged version. 
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_1.png">
  <img src="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_1.png"
     class="screenshot" width="400" style="float: left; vertical-align:top"></a>
  The viewport is where the main action occurs. It displays all the items from
  your datasource that match the filters set in the control panel.
</p>
<p>
  You can pan the viewport by clicking with your mouse in any empty area and then
  dragging the mouse around, or by using your mousewheel, or by using your
  finger if you are accessing Rhizosphere from a touch-capable device.
</p>
<p>
  You can also freely rearrange the visualized items via drag'n'drop.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both">Layout selector</h3>
<p>
  <a href="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_2.png">
  <img src="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_2.png"
     class="screenshot" width="400" style="float: left; vertical-align:top"></a>
  The layout selector let you choose how to organize the items in the viewport.
  You can choose among different algorithms, from simple lists to buckets, trees
  and more complex alternatives.
</p>
<p>
  In the example, the layout is configured to cluster items by their price
  range.
</p>

<h3 style="clear: both">Selection management</h3>
<p>
  <a href="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_3.png">
  <img src="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_3.png"
     class="screenshot" width="400" style="float: left; vertical-align:top"></a>
  The selection buttons let you narrow the set of visualized items down to the
  ones you explicitly selected, to remove unwanted items from the visualization.
</p>

<p style="clear: both">
  <a href="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_selection_0.png">
  <img src="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_selection_0.png"
     class="screenshot" width="400" style="float: left; vertical-align:top"></a>
  You can select items by simply clicking them, or by using drag selection.
</p>
<p>
  To enable drag selection, click the selection toggle in the lower-right corner
  of the visualization. You can then use your mouse to draw rectangular areas
  and select any item that falls within the area.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both">Filters</h3>
<p>
  <a href="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_4.png">
  <img src="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_4.png"
     class="screenshot" width="400" style="float: left; vertical-align:top"></a>
  By using the filters on the left control panel, you can filter out any items
  that do not match your current interest (say, for example, you don't want
  to see any book that has not received at least a 3-star rating).
</p>
<p>
  Using the autocommit checkbox you can decide to immediately remove from the
  visualization any item that doesn't match the current set of filters, or
  simply grey them out and remove them later.
</p>

<h3 style="clear: both">Navigation</h3>
<p>
  <a href="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_5.png">
  <img src="/static/doc/img/rhizosphere_ui_5.png"
     class="screenshot" width="400" style="float: left; vertical-align:top"></a>
  By using your browser back and forward buttons, you can navigate through any
  filters, layout, or selection you applied to the visualization. This will
  help you return to a previous visualization state and facilitate the
  exploration of your data.
</p>
<p class="note">
  <strong>Note</strong>. This feature is only enabled on browsers that support
  the latest HTML5 specifications. See
  <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/rhizosphereui/Home/announcements/statefulvisualizationswithhtml5history">
    this article</a> for further info.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both">Use it with your data</h2>
<p>
  You can now move on to using Rhizosphere with your own data. The easiest
  way to start is to
  <a href="/doc/users_spreadsheets.html">load your data into a Google Spreadsheet</a>.
  Alternatively you can <a href="/doc/users_embed.html">Embed Rhizosphere</a> in your
  webpages and feed it data using the
  <a href="/doc/users_jsformat.html">Rhizosphere data format</a>.
