<h1>Development Setup</h1>
<p>
  These instructions will guide you in setting up a local Rhizosphere
  development environment on your machine.
</p>
<p>
  The instructions assume you are executing them on a Linux machine.
</p>
<h2>Environment setup</h2>
<p>At the very minimum, you must have these tools installed on your machine,
  to modify and test Rhizosphere source code on your machine:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Python language interpreter
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Available at <a href="http://www.python.org/">www.python.org</a>. If you
    are running on Linux is probably already installed on your system.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Google AppEngine SDK
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Although Rhizosphere is pure js, the library code is served by a small
    Appengine application. Download the SDK from
    <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">code.google.com/appengine</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Mercurial
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> is Rhizosphere's
    distributed version control system.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Some Rhizosphere demos and showcase applications require additional libraries
  that are not included by default in the Rhizosphere codebase and you
  must download separately. This include:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Python GData Client</dt>
  <dd>
    Some Rhizosphere demos are rely on
    <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/">GData</a> feeds for the data
    they consume, via the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/">
      gdata-python-client</a> library. The library must be place in the
    <code>appengine/shared</code> directory after you have downloaded
    Rhizosphere source code. See the <code>appengine/shared/README.txt</code>
    file for further info.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>If you also want to produce Rhizosphere release packages, you need this
  additional tools:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Closure Compiler
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rhizosphere uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/">
    Closure Compiler</a> to minify and compress its javascript code for
    production deployment.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    NodeJS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> is used as part of the Rhizosphere
    build and release toolchain.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    LessJS
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="http://github.com/cloudhead/less.js">less.js</a> is a dynamic
    styling language that extends CSS. Rhizosphere uses the
    <a href="http://www.lesscss.org">LESS</a> language to dynamically create
    its stylesheets.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>From now on, let's assume you installed the tools in a
  <code>$RHIZOSPHERE_TOOLS</code> directory.
</p>

<h3>Download a local copy of Rhizosphere</h3>
<p>Download a local copy of the code from the version control system:</p>
<pre>
  $ cd
  $ hg clone https://rhizosphere.googlecode.com/hg rhizosphere
</pre>

<h3>Start serving Rhizosphere locally</h3>
<p>
  Start an AppEngine instance pointing it at the launcher code contained
  within the downloaded source code:
</p>
<pre>
  $ cd rhizosphere
  $ $RHIZOSPHERE_TOOLS/appengine/dev_appserver.py appengine/src/
</pre>
<p>
  You can now access the Rhizosphere samples at
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080/</a>.
</p>

<h2>Local development</h2>
<p>
  You can access all the Rhizosphere samples from the launcher interface at
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080/</a>, or a single sample
  directly from the <code>rhizo.html</code> endpoint:
</p>
<pre>
  http://localhost:8080/rhizo.html?<strong>d=1</strong>&amp;src=<i>sample/people.js</i>
</pre>
<p>
  Change the <code>src</code> attribute to point to different samples.
  Remember to use the <code>d=1</code> url parameter to enable development
  mode (Rhizosphere files are served unbundled and not minified, CSS files
  are compiled on the fly from their LESS specification).
</p>
<p>
  Some experimental Rhizosphere features are also protected by an <code>exp</code>
  URL parameter which must be set to <code>1</code> to enable them.
</p>
<p>
  You can also look at the <a href="contrib_tables.html">Reference Tables</a>
  for available parameters and settings.
</p>

<h3>Development mode</h3>
<p>
  By appending the <code>d=1</code> parameter to local URLs you enable the
  development mode. When in development mode:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    All rhizosphere javascript source files are served separately and
    uncompressed to the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    CSS files are compiled on the fly from their LESS source (Rhizosphere
    uses <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> for easier CSS styling).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This makes it easier to develop and debug code: just reload your browser
  for it to pick up your changes.
</p>

<h2>Production deployment</h2>
<p>
  To optimize Rhizosphere code for production deployment and prepare a
  Rhizosphere release, these are the required steps.
</p>
<p>Pack the javascript source code into a single minified library.You can use
  the <code>packer.py</code> tool that ships with Rhizospher source code:
</p>
<pre>
  $ cd $HOME/rhizosphere
  $ ./packer.py --compiler=$RHIZOSPHERE_TOOLS/closurecompiler/compiler.jar
</pre>
<p>
  This will create a packed library in the default location of
  <code>lib/js/rhizo.pack.js</code>
</p>
<p class="note">
  <strong>Tip</strong>. Have a look at other available packing options via the
  <code>./packer.py --help</code> command.
</p>
<p>Then, compile and minify the Rhizosphere CSS files:</p>
<pre>
  $ $RHIZOSPHERE_TOOLS/nodejs/bin/node $RHIZOSPHERE_TOOLS/lessjs/bin/lessc -x \
    src/stylesheets/rhizo.less lib/stylesheets/rhizo.css
</pre>
<p>
  This will create a packed stylesheet in
  <code>lib/stylesheets/rhizo.css</code>.
  You can now copy the packed javascript and stylesheet elsewhere and use them
  within your projects.
</p>
<pre>
  $ cp lib/js/rhizo.pack.js lib/stylesheets/rhizo.css /path/to/your/other/project
</pre>
<p>
  If you also want to deploy Rhizosphere appengine application, then issue:
</p>
<pre>
  $ $RHIZOSPHERE_TOOLS/appengine/appcfg.py update appengine/src
</pre>
