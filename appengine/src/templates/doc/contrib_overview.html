<h3>About submitting patches and code changes</h3>
<p>
  If you modified Rhizosphere source code and you want your changes to be
  included in the library, send us a patch.
</p>
<p>
  For small changes, just use the
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rhizosphere/issues/entry?template=Patch%20submission">
    Patch submission</a> form and attach the patch directly to it.
</p>
<p>
  For bigger changes, it would be great if you could first roll out your patch
  in a cloned Rhizosphere repository and then notify us via the
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rhizosphere/issues/entry?template=Patch%20submission">
  Patch submission</a> form, so we can do a proper code review on your
  submission if necessary.
</p>
<p>
  For any questions, feel free to contact the team via the
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rhizosphere/topics">
    discussion group</a>.
