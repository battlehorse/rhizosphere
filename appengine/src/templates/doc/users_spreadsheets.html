<h1>Use with Google Spreadsheets</h1>
<p>
  This page describes how you can use Rhizosphere withing a
  <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Spreadsheet</a>.
</p>

<p>
  First, login to <a href="http://docs.google.com">docs.google.com</a> and
  create a new spreadsheet. Start entering some data or import them from an
  external source, until you're satisfied with the contents.
  For example, here is the
  <a href="https://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?key=tfsbXD2LYRhYmC_SRKSreXA&hl=en_GB#gid=0">
    spreadsheet I created</a> to decided which mobile phone is right for me.
  You can access it live, and copy it for your experiments.
</p>
<p>
  You should organize your data according to these rules:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every <strong>row</strong> should represent an item to be displayed,</li>
  <li>Every <strong>column</strong> should represent an attribute or
    characteristic your items have.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Select a range of cells. Then from the toolbar, choose
  <strong>Insert &gt; Gadget</strong>. Choose to insert a
  <strong>custom</strong> gadget and type in this URL:
</p>
<pre>
  http://www.rhizospherejs.com/ig
</pre>
<p>
  Click the Add button. This will add the Rhizosphere gadget on your
  spreadsheet and open its configuration page, as shown here:
</p>
<img src="/static/doc/img/gadgetinfo.png"
     class="screenshot" style="border: 1px solid #bbb">
<p>
  Verify that the <strong>Range</strong> option matches the cells you want to analyze,
  or adjust it accordingly. That's it!
</p>

     class="screenshot" style="border: 1px solid #bbb">
<p>
  Try using the menus in the bottom bar to change the items layout and filter
  them. You can also drag them around, select them (just click them) and
  restrict your work on the selected items only.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose the <strong>Autoanalyze data</strong> checkbox within the gadget
  options, Rhizosphere will do its best to extract new dimensions out of your
  data. In the above example it's using colors and sizes to display
  differences in prices and weights of the phones. A legend is provided
  if you feel confused.
</p>

<h2>Fullscreen mode</h2>
<p>
  Rhizosphere can operate in different modes depending on how much space it has
  to render its contents. So far Rhizosphere has been constrained to a
  gadget-size rendering.
</p>
<p>
  Withing Google Spreadsheets you can move Rhizosphere to his own sheet (from
  the gadget options, choose <strong>Move to own sheet...</strong>). Rhizosphere
  will then render itself using the full-page user interface, which you have
  already seen in the <a href="/doc/users_overview.html">Using Rhizosphere</a> section.
</p>

<h2>Advanced Gadget options</h2>
<p>
  When Rhizosphere is embedded inside a spreadsheet as a gadget, you have
  access to a set of advanced options.
</p>
<p>
  Choose the <strong>Edit Gadget...</strong> link from within the gadget menu,
  and you will have access to a set of advanced configuration options:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Range / Datasource URL</dt>
  <dd>The range of cells (if inside a Google Spreadsheet) or the datasource
    (if inside another gadget container like iGoogle) that Rhizosphere uses to
    extract the data to visualize.</dd>
  <dt>Fancy Animations</dt>
  <dd>
    Animates transitions, layouts and filtering. Disable this if you experience
    slowness or you are working with many ( hundreds ) elements.
    You can usually keep this on with any worries.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Autoanalyze data
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Rhizosphere will try to understand the type of your data and modify the
    display accordingly. It will use the first column as the label for every
    item, and map the first two numeric columns to the color and size of each
    element. You can override this defaults by using the options labeled
    as Advanced.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    When Fullscreen, show
  </dt>
  <dd>
    When in fullscreen mode, Rhizosphere will display more fields for each item,
    rather than the label only. Here you can specify how many fields you want
    to see.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Advanced, as Label use
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Explicitly specify the column ( either by typing its name or its
    identifying letter ) that Rhizosphere will use as label for each item.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Advanced, as Size use
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Explicitly specify the column ( either by typing its name or its
    identifying letter ) that Rhizosphere will use as the Size for each item.
    The column should contain a numeric value. Bigger numbers will result in
    bigger sizes.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Advanced, as Color use
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Explicitly specify the column ( either by typing its name or its
    identifying letter ) that Rhizosphere will use as the Color for each item.
    The column should contain a numeric value. Rhizosphere will use a color
    palette where bigger numbers will result in darker shades of the palette
    color.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Other tips and tricks</h3>
<p>
  Normally filters over text columns are represented as input fields where you
  can type in strings that will be matched against the column values.
  You can transform them into dropdown selection boxes by adding the word
  <code>CAT</code> (uppercase) to the column header.

<p>
  Do you want a selection box that allow multiple choices? Use the word
  <code>CATMUL</code> instead.
